## How to Run OSC-CO2

### 1. Object Mask Refinement

This module is ran in Jupyter Notebook and the file is 'object_mask_refinment.ipynb'. You may create a new environment with the listed dependencies or import our 'env_oscco2.yml' by using the following code in the terminal: 'conda env create -f env_oscoo2.yml'. 

### 2. Mask Generalization

This module is ran via command prompt and the file is 'mask_optimization.py'. You may need to edit the file to input your own paths to the images. 

### 3. Results

This part is ran in MATLAB R2020b. It computes the Jaccard, Precision, Recall, and F1.
